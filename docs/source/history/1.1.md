Ver. 1.1.2 - 2016-Feb-04
============================
* Removed ``release`` application and created a [new repository](https://github.com/quantmind/pulsar-agile) for it
* ``wait`` method in ``greenio`` app accepts an extra parameter for checking if in child greenlet
* Specialised ``MustBeInChildGreenlet`` error for functions which should be called on a child greenlet
* Critical bug fix in ``pubsub`` subscribe method for Redis backend
* Added an asynchronous ``wsgi.file_wrapper`` to the WSGI environment
* Added ``file_response`` utility to serve local files
* Introduced ``pulsar.ensure_future`` in place of ``pulsar.async``


Ver. 1.1.1 - 2016-Jan-06
============================
* Full support for python 3.5
* Pulsar **1.1.x** is the last minor release ("major.minor.micro") to support python 3.4
* From pulsar **1.2.x**, support for python 3.4 will be dropped and the new
  [async-await][] syntax will be used in the whole codebase

Core
-----------------
* Added CI for python 3.5
* Added ``debug`` properties to all ``AsyncObject``. The property returns the event loop
  debug mode flag

HttpClient
----------------
* Backward incompatible changes with API much closer to [requests][] and far better support for streaming both uploads and downloads
* Added ``content`` attribute to ``HttpResponse``, in line with [requests][]
* Ability to pass ``stream=True`` during a request, same API as python [requests][]
* Added the ``raw`` property to the Http Response, it can be used in conjunction with
  ``stream`` to stream http data. Similar API to [requests][]
* Renamed ``proxy_info`` to ``proxies``, same API as python [requests][]
* You can now pass ``proxies`` dictionary during a request
* Stream uploads by passing a generator as ``data`` parameter
* Better websocket upgrade process
* Tidy up ``CONNECT`` request url (for tunneling)
* Added tests for proxyserver example using [requests][]

WSGI
------
* Both ``wsgi`` and ``http`` apps use the same ``pulsar.utils.httpurl.http_chunks``
  function for transfer-encoding ``chunked``
* ``render_error`` escapes the Exception message to prevent [XSS][]

Data Store
-----------
* Better ``pulsards_url`` function, default value form ``cfg.data_store``
* ``key_value_save`` set to empty list by default (no persistence)

Examples
-------------
* Refactored proxy server example
* Updated django chat example so that warning are no longer issued
